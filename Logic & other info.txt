Program Logic :-

1.Firstly, stored all the ones and tens words as the static strings(Ones,Tens)
2.Written a function to convert the given input place by place into words by using if else conditionals.
   By which we can convert the currency value (Min Value 00, Max Value 9, 99, 99, 999.99) into text.
3.In the main function, after the initiation of all the needed variables while loop is used to apply some validations.
Validations:-*validate if the input is a number.
                         *validate if the input is a greater than or equal to 0.
                         *check if the input is exeeding the max limit or not.
                         *check if the input is empty or not.
Fullfilling these conditions loop breaks.
4.Then, some if else conditions  to print the numbers after the decimal point as a fraction of 100.
5.Then, function call to get the converted text in beforeDecimal variable. 
6.final if condition to get the desired output in the given format.
7.Printing the final output after connecting all the dots.
